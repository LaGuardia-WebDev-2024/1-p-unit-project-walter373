          Origin Story/Background Info 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rocky is my dog. He is <strong>8 years old</strong> and was born on January 18.<br> 
        He is a pitbull and he started as a foster dog that we ended up adopting.<br>
        Rocky's favorite food is boiled sweet potatoes. He also loves ground beef.<br>
        His older sister Zoey passed away last year. They were <em>inseperable. </em> <br>
